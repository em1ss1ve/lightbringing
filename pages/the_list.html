<h2 id="org70f571b"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Purpose</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This is a place for me to share the ideas that I'm considering with the people in my life
and anyone else interested.
</p>

<p>
When the bible opens with the passage, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
God, and the Word Is God.", what this is referring to is the process by which anything and
everything is created, but the bible makes the mistake of assuming that the word is god,
and not that place in/from which the word emanates." The God which is the Word is the child
of The Great Mother, who is Emptiness, in all of her infinite manifestations, of which the
Word is but one. The Image is another, as is The Feeling, The Impression, The Sound, and
Awareness itself, and The Word is unique only in the fact that it is a convenient means of
conveying the rest. The Image is more instantaneous, but isn't as preferred because it acts
on that part of ourself which lay beyond our conscious control (and as such requires
coaxing to understand). I have fallen in love with the Image.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
I would like to offer an alternative way of approaching life, allowing for freedom in every
moment. I want to provide a bulletproof means of escaping the trap of nihilism; I want to help you free yourself.
Our time is limited to fall in love with life; our dreams are possible, but only if we are willing to confront the thing
that scares us most.

<h3 id="orgeb4393b"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Analysis of Circumstances</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Complacency is complicity. The world is falling apart, and the single most powerful
myth-loom has been coopted by a far-right lunatic intent on taking away the rights of
anyone who isn't rich, white, cis, and straight, and using the machinery of government only
for the benefit of his 'pure-blood' cohort. The wrong have proven time and again that they
are highly effective at keeping this system running by manufacturing fear and hatred and
desire, and that they are so good at this that they have people truly believing they are
seeing the benefits of this system directly, even as he strips the people around them of
their rights, drives up the cost of food, and flies completely in the face of every noble
value upon which this country is built. This is a country of colonizing immigrants who have
no right to control the borders of land that they stole.
</p>

<p>
We have become so blinded to the possibilities which this world can hold for us because we
have been fed for so long a diet of sugary gruel, making us fat, lazy, and stupid, in order
that we will be more easily led off to a 9 to 5 slaughter which drains us of our vitality
and our money while the wealthy continue to increase their arbitrary control over us.
</p>

<p>
Some hope; society is entirely composed of people, which means that it is people who are
capable of changing the way that it operates. You are a person, you are the society, and
you can easily effect change in the world by pushing yourself and the people around you to
do the same.
</p>

<p>
LET LOVE WIN. For too long, the wrong have used outright lies, propaganda, and manufactured
hatred to spread nonsense for the purposes of creating division amongst us, which prevents
us from working together to protect our freedoms, but this TOO is a choice! Hatred is a
choice and harm is a choice! LOVE FEELS GOOD! Why would you want to be scared all the time
that someone is going to steal from you or rape you or take away your money or your life?
No matter what they do, <i>nothing is worse than living a miserable life</i>. I would rather die
enrapt in the overwhelming ecstacy of love than ever be scared again, and so I won't be,
and you don't have to either! <i>I would die for this world because I love it</i>! Most of my
fondest memories aren't of wasting away between four walls while I watch the hours wash
away what short time I have on this planet as LCDs flash, they are memories made of spending time in
nature, of going on hikes, of watching the sun rise and set and settling into the
wilderness. They are composed of sharing in imaginal experiences with the people I care
about. Don't get me wrong, I think it's wonderful that we have gained all of this
information that we now have access to because people loved the world around them enough to
try to understand it, but <i>we treat the earth like shit</i>. <i>WE LET OUR LIVES PASS UNREMARKABLY
WHILE WE ARE IN AN INTENTIONALLY MANUFACTURED DOPAMINE TRANCE, FEASTING ON THE CARRION OF
IDEAS LIKE VULTURES, CAREFULLY CURATED TO STARVE US OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD PUSH US TO SEE A
WAY OF LIVING WHICH IS APPEALING ENOUGH THAT WE WANT TO CHANGE OUR WAYS.</i>
</p>

<p>
IT'S ENTIRELY A CHOICE TO CONTINUE LIVING AN UNFULFILLING LIFE. If you aren't happy with
the way you're living, it's probably because you're living in a way which is in conflict
with the values you hold and the things that you want to achieve. We have been sold the lie
that the only way to be happy, <i>the only way to be safe</i> (the subtext) is to CONSUME AND
CONFORM, to strip ourselves of our ideosyncracies and our creativity, because to do
otherwise would make you DIFFERENT (UNSAFE). They have taken us out of a world of
possibility and innovation, where with enough effort anything is possible into one where
there are only two states, RIGHT AND WRONG, GOOD (safe) or BAD (dangerous). <i>Binaries are
the most powerful tool of oppression.</i> Look at nature; everything exists in a spectrum of
being, completely interreliant on everything around it. NATURE DOESN'T HAVE AN INDOORS AND
OUTDOORS, nor any other binaries. We have been lied to! Nature is completely safe, when we are willing to be one
with it, to learn it's ways and re-naturalize.
</p>

<p>
The education system is designed to make us conform, not to teach us to learn. If education
were truly about learning, then WE WOULD SHOW STUDENTS HOW TO FIND ANSWERS TO THEIR
QUESTIONS. We wouldn't dismiss them or discourage them, because CURIOSITY IS AN EXPRESSION
OF LOVE; <i>to be curious is to be so in love with some thing that you want nothing more than
to understand it in all its' complexities!</i> Instead, we show people that the only things
they need to know are the right answers on the next test, and that after that
it doesn't matter. <i>This teaches us that the only things which we need to learn is that which
appeases our superiors</i>. Our country doesn't want people to be curious, because if
they're curious, then they might start asking questions that have the possibility of
revealing obscured information (which is why the government is obliterating the education system
and dismantling our systems of knowledge management).
</p>

<p>
THERE IS NOTHING MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE WORD 'WHY?', IT IS THE SHARPEST KNIFE WHICH HAS
EVER BEEN INVENTED. WIELD WITH CARE.
</p>

<p>
POWER IS CONTROLLED IN TWO WAYS: FORCE, and INFORMATION. PREVENTING OR CONTROLLING THE FLOW
OF INFORMATION IS THE SINGLE MOST POWERFUL WAY OF KEEPING CONTROL OVER THE PEOPLE. This is
why the internet is controlled by only a handful of companies; it makes it easy to monitor
and easy to control the information that's provided. When the internet was first created,
it was envisioned as a decentralized network - hence NET; each computer was a node,
interconnected with every other computer. It should be a public service, as should
software.

<div id="outline-container-org0fbb41b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0fbb41b"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Offering a Reason For Being</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
We face a crisis of meaning in our modern society; when faced with the horrors of humanity
and the world, the response of individuals has overwhelmingly been complacency and willful
ignorance, or complete denial. I see this a being the result of previously created systems
of meaning-making being inadequate at providing a helpful framework through which to
conceptualize the massive amounts of pain which they see around them.
</p>

<p>
The abyss is the pit of meaning, within which reason is dead.
</p>

<p>
How then do we escape?
</p>

<p>
Option 1: Ignorance
</p>

<p>
Choose not to see life for the tragedy that it is; continue living your life in the way
that you have, trying to "focus on what makes you happy".
</p>

<p>
Option 2: Nihilism
</p>

<p>
Witness the fact that this is all devoid of fundamental meaning. Understand that everything
that helps us to contextualize our lives is entirely empty of anything real, as it's
foundations are nothing more than human thoughts and memories of an approximation of an
experience based in extremely limited information. Why even bother do anything, it isn't as
though any of this is real anyway, it isn't as though any of this <i>matters</i>. Consider
suicide. Understand that it wouldn't change anything at a fundamental scale; it would
<i>only</i> effect those who care for you.
</p>

<p>
Option 3: Buddhism
</p>

<p>
Peer into the void; understand that there's nothing that can actually give our lives
meaning, not even god, for (in the case that god exists) we cannot know his machinations,
and as such they aren't useful to consider. Understand that attachment is the root of all
suffering, and that even though our lives our an illusion, it's still a sacred illusion. It
says that compassion is that which is the most important thing, <i>especially</i> because life
is illusory. To understand this life to be entirely illusion is to fall in love with it
again, as though you were a child; you have the possibility in every moment to allow it to
be whatever it needs to be and to love <i>every single part</i> of it. You have the option to
fight for <i>love</i>, entirely and completely, because there's nothing that matters more. To
understand this life as an illusion makes suicide absurd; who is there to kill? What even
is <i>killing</i>? Science tells us that all of reality is fundamentally nothing more than
energy, so to "die" is just for there to be a re-arrangment of energy.
</p>

<p>
If everything is just energy, and the concept of the individual is just a creation of the
ego, then what is the point of doing anything? What is the point in <i>not</i> doing anything?
</p>

<p>
Buddhism answers this by suggesting "setting all beings free from the cycle of
suffering". Everything is the Buddha, everything is sacred, so everything ought to be
treated as though it were. Essentially, there is no reason for doing anything, but if you
really want something to work towards, have you considered making the world a better place?
</p>

<p>
Sartre ripped 'most everything from Siddharta, though this isn't new; most all of
'progressive' western thought is in some way either directly ripped from Buddhism, or
retreads ground which Buddhism already has. Look at Jung; his 'collective unconscious' is
just the 'storehouse consciousness' of Buddhism, or 'cause and effect', which is just a
neutered version of dependant origination, and the list goes on.
</p>

<p>
Why should we make the world a better place if the "world" isn't real?
</p>

<p>
The simple answer is because it feels good, the longer one is that everything is buddha and
because of this, it is in your best interest to show love towards everything and everyone
because none of it is separate from you, so to be loving to 'others' is to be loving to
'yourself'. 
</p>

<p>
It seems the case that individuals who are stuck in a framework of fight/flight/complacency
are nearly guaranteed to act only in what they think to be their best interests, which tend
to be centred around immediate gratification as a means of regulating their psychological
landscape enough that they can temporarily relax; the temporary distraction from the abyss
combined with a high release of dopamine creates a quickly habituated cycle of hollow
pleasure which is quite difficult to escape from. I would like to offer a suggestion.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mindfulness is quite exceptional for starting to re-align your being in order that you
are no longer operating from a place of fight or flight, as well as providing a means of
examining your actions. Continually using this tool is highly effective at allowing the
individual to relax and to begin to understand the things that cause fear in our lives
and to remove them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, imagination can serve as a means of allowing for an alternative experience of
the world which isn't governed by the instant gratification of much of the entertainment
which presents itself to us today. Our entire understanding of the world is imagined; a
coherent world is structured by the mind from the raw material of our sense organs, so the
imagination is nothing more than an extension of this ability to form coherent mental
experiences. Not only should this ability serve as a means of structuring the world around
us, but it ought to be brought back to being a means by which we can engage with one
another. The current socio-economic reality is one structured upon manufacturing desire,
but given that these objects are existing only within the imagination of the individual, it
follows that one ought to skip the middle-man and produce what they want; landscapes of
mind developed in order that they can be shared and frollicked within.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
This will act to provide a logical reasoning for why the individual ought to provide the
greatest benefit in the lives of others.
</p>

<p>
Premises
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You are an individual.</li>

<li>Environmental stressors effect the emotional wellbeing of individuals.</li>

<li>A 'Society' is formed of 'individuals', and society resides in the same biosphere.</li>

<li>Individuals under environmental stress are more likely to&#x2026;

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Perform less efficiently.</li>

<li>Act in such a way that creates environmental stress, whether emotionally or physically.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The more stress an individual in enduring, the less conscious they are of their
actions, their reactions, and the impact of their actions.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This can take a variety of forms, such as hoarding, aggressive/distracted driving,
use of intoxicants, cruelty or disregard for people, animals, and environment,
overconsumption, etc., and frequently these reactions occur partially because they
create the experience of a temporary alleviation of the stress.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>This, in turn, causes an increase in environmental stress, rippling outward amongst all
living beings, effecting not just the human population, but the entire biosphere.</li>

<li>As you, an individual, reside within this biosphere, consuming air, water, nutrients, and

<h2 id="orge571406"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Salvation Through the Imaginal</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I believe that the next step in the evolution of humanity is going to be imaginal; people
will no longer rely on their material possessions to determine their worth, nor will it be
material possessions for which they strive. I provide you with this bit of reasoning;
everything in the material world is subject to decay and destruction, and the only thing
that can truly be brought with you are the knowledge and experience which you have gained,
and other purviews of the mind. In addition, it it is the internal state of the individual
which is most responsible for their life, (when their most basic needs are met) so it is of
paramount importance to prioritize the creation of an ultimate state of being which is only
mediated by the whims of others insofar as they reside in compassion and benefit to others.
</p>

<p>
I envision a world where people are satisfied with their inner worlds (and the process of
sharing them with others) to a degree where they need basically nothing exterior in their
lives and can still find them incredibly fulfilling. I will provide an example of
this. There is a factory worker, who lives with two other people in a house which is big
enough to where they all have the option to spread out as much as they need to, but given
that they have almost nothing to their names (save for a method of storing and accessing
the worlds which they have created and the artifacts which they have created for those
worlds) they crave for no additional space. This person has a few plants to their name, and
their room is finely crafted yet minimal. They possess enough clothes for exactly eight
days, and these clothes are both extremely durable and comfortable. Given the lack of
objects, the space is easy to clean and maintain, and its spartan nature is comforting to
its inhabitant, who finds that the lack of distractions makes it easier for them to feel at
ease in the space. In their free time, they <i>create</i>; they spend the time they have
building out intricate worlds and societies and architecture and experiences, and they
share them with their roommates (who work on similar projects in their free time). Together
they share a project, one which they have all contributed to and which they can all
interact with. They have created characters which reside in this world, and they have taken
the time to thoroughly customise and individualise these characters, giving them distinct
and highly developed personalities. They have also contributed other characters to inhabit
this world, and when it comes time for one of their characters around whom the story which
they are collectively telling is centered decides to interact with one of these other
'world' characters (there are then personal characters and world characters), the person
who is responsible for creating this character takes the time to embody the personality of
this person and engages with the other individuals in this world. Given the fact that there
is a standardised (if flexible) set of rules by which individuals can take actions in
other's worlds, it becomes very easy to engage with someone's world for the first time, as
they are then responsible for determining how your engagement effects the world, and you
are responsible for choosing the actions that you wish to take in that world. To return to
the example, this factory worker has been spending the last couple days finely tuning the
imagined experience of a town, which, as a result of their choice to consider the
implications that a lack of gravity would have on the social and architectural expression
of culture over time and the plethora of other alterations to their way of life, they go to
their co-habitants with an explanation of the basic premise for this world, and they spend
some time creating individuals who could believably be understood to reside within this
culture. They spend some time exploring and creating this town and culture together, and
they are then all left with this mental impression of this town which they can carry with
them for the rest of their lives, which will offer them something to cconsider when they
have a lull in their responsibilities. The most wonderful part of this is that the next day
while the factory worker is at their job, because this is such a common practice that it
has become second nature, this person can share in similar worlds with their co-workers,
and as such, they are willing and excitied to go to work and to do their work (regardless
of what it is) because it offers the opportunity to do something productive while
simultaneously simple enough that it allows the mind time to wander and create. That day
while they are at work, they notice that one of the machines that they are working with has
an unintended feature of its design which makes it relatively uncomfortable to use, and
they become interested enough with this problem that they decide to consider the problem,
and because of this zero-gravity society which they have created for their own diversion,
and into which they decided to pour a decent amount of research regarding the production of
different materials and their traits under different environmental stressors), they realize
that because of the way the material of the handle is a made from is interacting with the
temperature accumulation in the main body of the tool, the differntial between the rate of
expansion of the materials is causing a very gradual loosening of the binding between the
handle and the barrel, and that this is what is causing the vibration which has begun to
cause the tool to become noticably less comfortable to use over time. While they are not
specialized in the field of tool design, through their own research they were able to gain
the necessary information to diagnose the problem which faced them, and they were then able
to pass this information on to the individual who is responsible for the provision of the
tools, as well as a description of the specifics of the problem present within the
object. The fact that they have generalized their studies in this way as a result of their
interest in creating a particularly realistic world (not that this is a tendency which
every individual prioritizes in the creation of their worlds) led to a solution to a
problem which they would otherwise have not been able to solve were they focussed only on
doing the bare minimum, and their transmission of this information to the people who are
responsible for creating this tool resulted in a massive reduction to the amount of waste
which would have been generated by the continued production of long-wear defective units,
leading to an improvement in the quality of life for not just the production team
responsible for creating the tool, but every individual who used those tools and in
society, with the degree of their provided benefit increasing exponentially with every
living being which lives during and after their time. It is in this way that every act,
every choice, every single object brought into this world becomes something which will
effect countless others, whether they are personally known or not. Every choice we make in
every moment is, as a result of the chain of cause and effect, universe altering (though
obviously to more or less subtle degrees). The choice to live in such a way which
simultaneously maximises your potential as an individual while also limiting the ways which
you contribute negatively is a choice which effects not only everyone you know, but also
yourself, in that the choices yyou make alter the world, and you live in and rely on the
world, because you are and are of the world. This is simultaneously the greatest gift and
the greatest curse; In every moment you are taking actions which either benefit or harm the
world, and this endows every moment with such a massive degree of power and sacredness
which makes the profundity and meaning of your existence embedded into every moment and
every experience, making every single individual responsible for the state of the
world. Everything is choices, including a lack of action, including the re-inforcement of
the status-quo through your engagement with it, leaving you personally responsible for the
heavens and hells which you see in the lives of every entity surrounding you at every
moment. Those choices which are the most pernicious are those which are only very slightly
harmful but which are engaged with habitually or unconsciously, as these are the easiest to
ignore. Habitual choices (however small) are those which become the most important, as they
are the choices which have the greatest impact over time. For example, if you only placed
ten bricks a day, you could build a two-thousand square foot house with eight foot tall
walls in only seven and a half years, and would be moving twenty-seven tons of bricks in
the process.
</p>

<p>
This would offer the opportunity for people to create something which is both deeply
personal and deeply fulfilling, something which engages whatever skill sets they are
trained in, and which also would 'train' individuals' curiosity in a variety of fields, in
addition to their creativity both within and without their chosen field of expertise. In
addition, this would created the conditions for human beings to flourish to a degree which
we have only begun to dream of, as the creation of these worlds would playfully train
verbal and visual prossessing, short and long-term memory, and processing speed, causing a
rapid evolution in the creative processing capabilities of the individuals in society,
while providing them a way to engage with the world which is far less destructive and far
more pleasant than the world in which we currently reside. In addition, this degree of
creative engagement would provide individuals with the tools they need to mentally simulate
entire societies fuctionings, and allow for them to then find more efficient and effective
economic and interpersonal structures. The hollow materialism which is so deeply embedded
in the western world would be given an outlet which is far less destructive and far more
productive, as an object which exists in the mind is an object which engages the mind to a
greater degree than a physical object necessarily might. In addition, I forsee this
contributing to an increased rapidity in the rate of scientific and technological progress,
as this sort of constant mental training/play would create such a robust intuitive
understanding of the functioning of objects and systems that it would nearly inevitably
lead to innovation. This process of tying information and ideas to mental objects will also
lead to them being accessed with greater ease in retrieval and duration of storage, as is
proven by the 'mental palace' of the greeks and the neuroscientific understanding that
memory is strengthened by the number of connections that a piece of information has. By
creating a mental object which has this information or concept embedded in it and storing
it in a mental location with related or relevant information, this object has a minimum of
two more connections automatically added to it (those being the created object and the
place where it is residing), and any additional connnections would only serve to solidify
it's reality. In addition, this process incorporates a multitude of different learning
styles and can easily be adapted to fit the preferred learning style of an individual.
</p>

<p>
Along these same lines, I would like to see a re-ordering of the education system to be
more in line with the styles of learning which individuals would actually benefit from. I
would liike to see it be the case that students are intrduced to a broad range of topics at
the beginning of the week, and then after that they can choose one (or more) that they find
really interesting, and do research about it and develop their skills relating to it. I
think that this style of teaching would be particularly effective because it would give
students something which they are interestested in engaging with, which will give them the
skills necessary to continue learning throughout their life (as learning is something which
is only sustained by a curiousity which can not be taught, only encouraged). In addition, I
think that we would be very quickly surprised by the quality of the education that students
would receive this way, as it would lead to such a generalized knowledge base that they
would become incredibly effective, or such a specific one that the same thing would
result. The wonderful thing about the structure of information is that it builds off other
information, and that concepts can be traced through and sometimes applied to multiple
areas of study, meaning that when a student would become interested in something and follow
it, they would naturally pick up information from other disciplines, especially if they
were frequently introduced to interesting information. This degree of novelty would lead to
them retaining more of the information, and the passion which would result would create
individuals who are incredibly effective at teaching themselves, which is a necessary skill
in all areas of life, meaning that people would flourish as well-rounded. I have a really
difficult time thinking that I'm the first person to have thought of this, (because it's
really quite obvious) which leads me to think that this is known, but that it is not
pursued because it would make the broader society far more difficult to subjugate. I am by
no means the first person to have this thought, but I do genuinely think that the wealthy
(who have money, which equals power and influence in our society) only want the broader
public educated to a degree to where they aren't a threat to this money which they
supposedly deserve. I think that this structure of teaching/learning could be structured
through having professors/teachers who also have a wide knowledge base, and who are
accessible across the board. When a student has a question that the teacher can't answer,
they will be pointed to another teacher who has expertise in that area, and can make an
appointment to meet with them. Students would be expected to demonstrate their learning of
course, though this would be evaluated on a student by student basis, and could be done
through the student producing an object or model, writing a report, giving a presentation,
etc., the important part being that their choice in demonstrating their knowledge must be
in a method of the student's choice. This would also solve a lot of the accessibility
issues which education currently faces, as many of them are a result of the difficulties
which certain students face with certain methods of demonstrating or consuming
knowledge. While it is possible that this higher degree of individualization could create
greater stress on the education system, that should be something that we are the least
concerned about of any aspect of this. Education is the single most important skill, as it
is the skill around which all others revolve, so it makes sense that it should be the
highest investment in every country. Additionally, it would follow that this method of
learning wherein information is encoded into objects and worlds are built might be
encouraged, as this is something which is already present in the way that individuals
encode information from a young age, and so it wouldn't be somtheing which is necessary to
teach them, only to encourage.
</p>

<p>
We also need to slow our society down. We need to return to the things that we are really
passionate about, as a hollow drive to be a cog in the machine of 'progress' will only ever
lead to being blindly led to your slaughter by a corporate overlord who realizes your
obedience to the illusion of meaning which he has given you. Progress doesn't mean shit if
people don't have a high quality of life. Progress should be oriented around improving the
quality of life of every individual, not pushing towards profit. Why would you want any
amount of money if you could have a life which truly meant something to you, which you were
able to use for something that you not only believed in, but something that you actually
found fulfilling. This way of living is something that should be available to every person
regardless of their background, and it isn't even that difficult, because what it requires
more than anything is other people with whom to interact, and basic needs met. We have more
than enough to meet the basic needs of every person, and this will continue to be the case
if we create TAKE BACK OUR POWER. The cutoff for the amount of wealth that the richest
person in the world can have should be the GDP per person of the least wealthy country,
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL EQUAL.
</p>

<p>
I'm certain that with time and practice, anyone will be able to create these worlds for
themselves, and society will transform drastically in the way that information is concieved
of at a basic level. Gone will be the days where people talk about the weather, and come
have the days of people discussing either the worlds that they have created with one
another, or alone. People will be in a state of constant imagination, not because they wish
to escape from the world or from the experience of it, but because they wish to enhance
every facet of their experience. You can walk down the street, and it will instantly come
alive in an infinite variety of possibilities that you have dreamed up from your own
consciousness, and you will be able to follow any that you might wish.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-1-1-1">
<p>
One of the greatest questions which human beings face is motivation. Motivating oneself to
do things can be exceptionally difficult, but can become easier when the individual is in
possession of a reason greater than themselves. We are facing a crisis of meaning in our
society, and I see this as an outgrowth of a lack of percieved value and service to their
actions and lives. Many people are able to operate at a basic level without meaning in
their lives, but I have observed a lack of fulfillment, and a greater fracturing of the
social structure, and I think that these are interconnected. Also at play is the
understanding that the world is being consumed to death, which makes many with consciences
feel that they are part of the problem, but they also don't know what they can do to
help. These people wallow in consumption, suffering tremendously, and they have no meaning
through which to fill the pit in their lives.
</p>

<p>
Western culture has primarily developed around two threats; the threat of violence, and the
threat of deprivation (though this is in many ways equally violent in its reality.) Should
an individual choose not to conform to the rules which are set by the governing body,
society has a (near) monopoly on the use of force. Those who choose not to conform to the
social rules are frequently threatened with this same use of force, though not as overtly
by the governing body as by its' constituents, of whom many are perfectly comfortable
enforcing the status quo. This social violence can also manifest as deprivation (whether of
opportunity, material, housing, connection, etc.), and can have results which are equally
violent. Thus, the only way not to face this threat of violence is believed to be
conformity to a certain socially established path of development and way of living,
preventing the true social innovation which is required for a social evolution which is
becoming increasingly important as the threat of global warming becomes pertinant. If there
has ever been a time when non-conformity is important, it's now, and to a degree which is
existential. Similarly, it seems obvious that our culture would be violent and depressed
when the pillar upon which people are motivated to live and act is violence. Individuals
feel like they have no power because they are unwilling to face the fact that the systems
around them threaten their lives, as well as the fact that they have this same capacity for
violence within them, and that they are contributors to this cruelty through their
continued participation. People feel like they lack meaning and purpose in their lives
because most are fundamentally compassionate in their core, and are stuck in a system which
forces them to act in contradiction to this nature.
</p>

<p>
The question of whether people are currently truly compassionate at their core is
unnecessary, because if you believe that people are truly compassionate, then you will be
truly compassionate, causing others to be compassionate. 
</p>

<p>
It seems that there are overlapping but disparate motivators for the totality of human
activity: suffering, and meaning.
</p>

<p>
Meaning is understood as both understandings of signs and symbols, and as a framework for
living formed from human reason which drives specific action.
</p>

<p>
Suffering is understood not to be the pain which humans experience but the attachment to
not experiencing pain, as well as the attachment to experiencing pleasure. Suffering is the
desire for something to be different than it is, whether it be pain, a lack of pleasure, an
excess of something, etc. This is solved in two seemingly disparate but identical ways by
Christianity and Buddhism. In Christianity, the problem of the individual suffering is
solved by completely giving oneself over to the care of god with absolute trust. In
Buddhism, this is solved by understanding and releasing the origin of the suffering. Once
the origin of the suffering is identified as the craving for something not to be the case,
the individual can surrender the desire, and the suffering falls away, and when completely
internalized, this expands to an understanding which leads to a similarly complete
surrender. In the state of surrender, one lives in a complete presence, and their
compassionate fullness is revealed.

<li><a id="org12087ce"></a>In Defence of The Religious Artistic Mode of Being<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-1-1-2">
<p>
It has been observed that one of the best teachers of this state of surrender is the
artistic process, so it is necessary to create a religious framework for the creation of
art, as ritual can be exceptionally powerful at re-inforcing a state of flow in
practitioners.
</p>

<p>
The proof for the existence of a deity is not in the scope of this project, but it is
necessary to explain why a deity has been included in this, as well as the framework
through which it ought to be understood.
</p>

<p>
The deity which this framework is included is one which both exists and does not; it will
provide utility in life exactly proportional with belief. It exists as much as anything
else which we interact with on a daily basis exists; it is a convenient collection of
symbols through which to understand various states of experience, and postures for
approaching the world, which is not representative of the true reality. Capitalism is a
similar deity; it has certain signs, symbols, and understandings of the world which
together constitute a way of living life, and functions as it does only because everyone
believes it exists, yet it too is not actually representative of the true nature of
reality.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you have a sheet of paper. On this sheet of paper is written a promise
that I will give you a shirt that I'm borrowing from you back, as I know how much you love
this shirt, and that it also says that if I don't return that shirt, then you can get our
shared neighbor to use the key he has to my house (as he sometimes comes over to water the
plants) to either retrieve the shirt or take another similar shirt. Imagine as well that
our shared neighbor has an incredibly strong belief in the power of promises, and you give
him that sheet of paper (which now represents the imagined return of an object) in exchange
for him to rake your leaves. This is how all of money works.
</p>

<p>
Objects are abstracted into a representation of the energy (the effort applied over time),
and this representation of the energy (which has only imagined meaning) can be exchanged
for other objects, with the people with whom they are traded knowing that it means they
have the imagined promise for future objects. This, like religion, only works because
enough people believe in it.
</p>

<p>
The Metaphysics are similar; they offer signs and symbols which provide a way of viewing
life which is conducive to the creation of art, and are not meant to be understood as truly
representing reality.

</li>


<li><a id="orgd3d3cb1"></a>Tidbits<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-1-1-3">
<p>
All art is a process of discovery, of the transformation of endless nothingness into
something which has a degree of meaning or impression in the human mind greater than the
original constituents required for its creation.
</p>

<p>
We are facing a crisis in our species of our own making, and one might think that it would
be strange for me to then suggest that more art to be created, but there is reason for
this. People have for too long been relying on consuming other's creations, when these same
things can feel more satisfying when engaged with in a less substantial realm, with another
person. I have however witnessed a more powerful example of this imaginative play in
action, and have seen that when it is distilled, and when it is supported by enough people,
we habitually engage with it as reality.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, art can now be made in ways with a lower environmental impact than in the
past, and digital work could be a way to achieve this as long as we aren't relying on large
scale computing.
</p>

<p>
Just because everything is derived from nothingness both does and does not mean that our
lives (and thus creation) are meaningless. This is another trap for the mind, and part of
the reason for this projects' existence is as a means of working out of this trap.
</p>

<p>
All creation brings the individual in touch with the vital essence of the universe, and
although this is equally achieved through meditation, the focus of section is to explore
the possibilities of exploring and transcending the self through work done in the context
of sacredness.
</p>

<p>
One of the most important things to keep in mind during the process of creation is the very
subtle trap of attachment to the thing which is being made. Not only does this get in the
way of continued work on a piece, but it reduces the possibilities for what the piece can
be through the attachment to what it is. "IF YOU LOVE A SECTION OF A PAINTING, PAINT OVER
IT". - Corey Drieth, probably from Picasso.

All is infinite emptiness, an endless cycle of dependant manifestations of the Great
Mother, who is at once everything and nothing, spontaneously arising and ceasinig. Her
expanse is so truly infinite that materiality spontaneously arises, her face reflected in
every facet. She dreampt, and multitudes opened their eyes, believing themselves
apart. Those who can allow for spontaneous becoming without attachment are gifted her sweet
soma, which washes the dirt from their eyes, revealing in them her infinite compassionate
emptiness. She is the primordial artist, who has revealed the way that all has come into
being, spontaneously. Her radiance is spontaneous creation, her light is both stone and
paint, the world her canvas. It is by following this path that we might understand reality,
experiencing the process of becoming through the application of mind or material for the
creation of form.
</p>

<p>
She who is subtle infinity,
Clear light cast to form,
Her blessings manifest as obliterating embrace
In those who fall willing to her arms.
</p>

<p>
Her peace a salve,
Her face a spring,
Offering endless satisfaction.

May she shred the ropes we bind with,
Freedom as we fall through a void

<p>
Worlds built reveal paths towards alternate ways of living, breaking through the illusion
that we are trapped in only one way of being in the world, providing people with hope and
direction towards a more sustainable culture, and the process of creating these worlds will
show their creators the path towards understanding the nature of reality. As they become
more effective at creating these worlds, people might come to the understanding that they
are thus equally capable of having fabricated this entire experience of the world that they
call 'reality', and this will show them the path towards liberation.

It is my understanding that the ritualization of actions in service to something percieved
to be greater than the individual is useful for the formation of habits which result in
continued action, because the perception of sacredness creates an experience of greater
importance and deeper meaning.
</p>

<p>
HOW TO BALANCE THE CRITERIA FOR THE ART WITHOUT ATTACHMENT TO MAKING ART IN THAT WAY
</p>

<p>
There are a variety of methodologies for the production of artwork, each with varying
degrees of reliance on the form constructing imagination present within each human being,
and these are generally presented as follows:
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that each of these processes have two submethodologies, one of pure
discovery, and one of preconception.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A complete lack of visual imagination in the creation of work created directly from life
or copied from reference. The external senses are relied upon in near entirety, and this
approach will sometimes mix with the next approach to result in the recordings of
internal impressions of external experiences, as seen in Mondrian, early Picasso, some
academic art, etc.</li>

<li>A near-complete lack of visual imagination in the creation of abstract artwork, with
only general impressions of form and colour discovered in its creation.</li>

<li>A relative reliance on the visual imagination for the manipulation of form referenced
from either life or media to allow for greater accuracy in the creation of form from
imagination. This is very effective for training the individual for the next method.</li>

<li>A complete reliance on the visual imagination, with all form being discovered through
the interaction of the individual with the materials which they are utilizing for
creation. This can be enacted through inspiration via the creation of shapes, colours,
or forms. This category also has varying degrees based on the amount of reliance on
memory and previously witnessed form.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Inspiration is both inevitable, and is frequently a mental trap used for justifying a lack
of creation. These same categories can be applied to writing, music, math, engineering, and
any other undertaking which results in creation. Inspiration can only find you when you're
working.

Take the place where death is to occur, and finish covering yourself with the funerary
shroud which has been created. Close your eyes, and begin by taking deep breaths, allowing
them to slow down as they will, and begin to feel the embrace of the Great
Mother. Understand that this will be the end of who you were, that everything for which you
hoped and feared will no longer mean anything, as it will be cast into the void. As who you
were had been, so it shall end, as all things will. As you begin to relax, start to
visualize the space around you. Visualize wherever it is that you have chosen as your final
resting place, and start to step outside of the body, finding your way around the space
once you have attained a deep enough absorbtion.
</p>

<p>
After you are comfortable with the space and the body, invite the Great Mother into the
space through whatever means you see fit, and recite the following. 
</p>

<p>
'I give myself over completely to you, Great Mother, who are perfect Emptiness, and pledge
to realize your immanence. I give everything I am to you for the benefit of all sentient
beings, that this body will become your vessel through which to show the path through
attachment and aversion, and which will instantiate your infinite compassion for all
sentient beings. Might those who are attached to who I believed to be myself find peace in
truth. As the craving for the destruction of the self has been observed, so shall it come
to pass, that a lotus might sprout.'
</p>

<p>
Should the Great Mother of Emptiness choose to inhabit the body, watch as it becomes her
vessel, experience it as what was your body becomes a vessel for her infinite compassion,
and be grateful that it might be used more effectively as a means of setting sentient
beings free from the cycle of suffering. Visualize that she takes your essense, your body,
and all that you are, and embraces it, and as she does, see your heart stop beating, your
lungs stop breathing, and your blood stop pumping. Allow yourself to dissolve into her
arms, letting all experiences melt into her, understanding that as this happens, who you
have been is now dead, and there is nothing left of who you were. Witness the body as it
begins to decay, watch the crows as they peck through the shroud, returning the body to the
earth, and watch as a flock leaves, the Resting Place now empty. Watch as from this
emptiness, the body is re-woven from the emptiness, know that it is her will; watch as the
flesh begins to take shape, and experience the Great Mother as the body is taken control
of, though now interconnected with the entirety of existence.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-2">
<p>
This is to be used at the onset of work on creative projects.
</p>

<p>
Visualize the Great Mother before you, and prostrate yourself, saying this prayer to her.
</p>

<p>
Great Mother, who is all that is, guide this act of creation, that it might become what is
needed to eliminate all suffering within the world. All is perfect, yet still suffering
exists, so for compassion for all sentient beings realize an act of creation which
causes individuals to experience and understand their true nature.
</p>

<p>
Continue visualizing her as you say this, and offer your entire essence to her in an act of
surrender, a reminder that it is she who is this.
</p>

<p>
Witness her as 'yourself' as she absorbs everything you believed to be yourself, experience
the death of the person who you took yourself to be, and feel the change as her infinite
compassion enters the body, flowing up the spine and permeating the entirety of the flesh.
</p>

<p>
Create.
</p>

<p>
End with the following prayer.
</p>

<p>
'Through the continued act of creation, all will be nourished with infinite love and
compassion, that attachment, aversion, and ignorance will be washed away, and the
colourless light of infinite emptiness/everythingness will be realized to permeate
completely.'

<li><a id="org103eed5"></a>The Ritual Itself<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-3-3-1">
<p>
Begin with two people, dressed in ceremonial robes, or black, whichever is more
convenient. They are in a dark room, and they light candles.
</p>

<p>
A cleansing ceremony takes place. This begins with rounds of deep breathing as each
participant focuses on their breath and slowly finds their way to stillness. After a few
minutes of this, a sound is produced.
</p>

<p>
'We take our hopes, our fears, our attachments and our aversions, and we lay them before
your feet, Oh Great Mother, that we might create without prejudice against the illusions
which form our percieved selves.'
</p>

<p>
Both parties close their eyes, and sit down. 
</p>

<p>
At this point, both people visualize a ball of half light and half dark which they
visualize sucking all of their hopes, fears, wishes, hatreds, and sadnesses into, and allow
it to grow large enough to consume their bodies, sucking out all that which is the suchness
of themselves. These spheres are given as an offering to the visualized Mother of
Emptiness.
</p>

<p>
'Void, your nature, sustainer of life, effective only because of your infinite
adaptation, able to fill any form and adapt to any surrounding, providing existence through
contrast with matter, infinite in both your stillness and your vibration, revealing form to
be at one with you.'
</p>

<p>
'Mother void, from whom all of reality is manifest, bless us, that we might bring worlds
into being from nothingness. Help us both to empty ourselves that our formless essence
might be revealed, that which you are the cause and creator of. We have given you our
individual perspectives that we may realize the unity of our essence with all, that we may
work as one being to create and experience this universe of our creation, such that we
might find the perfect freedom present in spontaneous creation, gaining deeper insight into
our true nature in the process.'
</p>

<p>
At this point, in the forehead of the Void Mother, an eye opens, endlessly black, and from
this eye emanates a complete void which is visualized to fill the entire space, leaving
nothing left of the persons which previously stood there.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing is now everything, and everything is now nothing. From this place infinite form
inevitably manifests. Might all be nourished.'
</p>

<p>
Now, the two individuals begin building the world, with either party speaking first when
something appears to them, and the process continues until both sides are satisfied with
what they have created together. To signal the end of the summoning, one party says 'It is
so.'
</p>

<p>
'Great Mother Void of whom this is, gratitude exists for the experience of creation. May
this permeate all levels of existence, and set all free from the cycles of suffering.'
</p>

<p>
The Great Mother is visualized to reveal both identical balls of light and darkness and
fuse them, which explodes into being as both participants open their eyes.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps at this point tea is made?
</p>

<p>
'As this tea is in this water, so are we in the world around us; the world is us and we are
the world.'

<li><a id="org4b29dc2"></a>A Non-ceremonialized version<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-3-3-2">
<p>
I think it is important that I present a version of this experience which isn't within the
confines of ritual, because I think that all of the drapery of the previous version might
put some people off, and I think that it's important that they experience it regardless.
</p>

<p>
Essentially, both people must agree within themselves to be vulnerable with the other, and
not to take anything that the other person says too personally. It is easy to be offended
by the other person not necessarily building directly off of what you try to add, or
disregarding it, and it doesn't mean that it wasn't a good idea, nor does it mean that you
aren't good at it. This is the whole reason why I have ritualized this; I want the people
experiencing this process together to understand the experience not as themselves, but as
mouthpieces for the shared font of creativity, not as individuals which can be hurt by
anything the other does.

<h4 id="org0083472"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.4.</span> The Ritual of Inner Journeying</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-4">
<p>
This ritual exists for the purposes of expanding your visualization abilities, and
interrogating various aspects of thineself, for the purposes of knowledge and creation. As
with all things related to the process of creation, this ought to be done with absolutely
no judgement, lest you permanently cut yourself off from the wellspring of creation. This
experience is initially intended to be performed alone, and only shared with people with
whom you have complete confidance. This is to be practiced every night before finding your
way into the gentle embrace of Mother Void, blessed be her name.
</p>

<p>
Begin by closing your eyes.
</p>

<p>
Complete seven triangular breathing cycles (7 seconds in, 7 second hold, 7 seconds out).
</p>

<p>
"Great Mother Emptiness, you of infinite manifestations, who are the womb of creation,
I ask thee to share what I need to see to aid in my development and understanding. May you
guide me to recognize my true nature, that I might share your gifts, and help to overcome
the cycle of suffering."
</p>

<p>
Begin to notice what you see, whether it be blankness, swirls, colour fields, shapes, etc.,
and start describing these out loud. Should these begin to develop into more elaborate
scenes, describe these, and should they not, describe regardless. Should you find yourself
in a place, describe what you see and slowly look around for anything moving. Do not, under
any circumstances, try to change anything. Should you find something moving, slowly
approach it if you can, and you may find this to be the beginning of a journey. The
entities which you encounter may be rather unusual or completely ordinary, but try to avoid
being adversarial, for they may be great sources of insight. The most important part of
this process is patience. Try to approach everything with a casual curiosity rather than
desire, and be content with anything which you experience.
</p>

<p>
When performing this ritual before sleep, you can forgo the closing until the morning.
</p>

<p>
"You of infinite manifestations, whose creations ring with the endless love of
sponteneity, thank you for guiding me in this experience. Might I continue to be your
faithful student, such that I might realize what I am, and use this knowledge for the
benefit of all that exists."
</p>

<p>
You may find that you want to record your experiences as you are having them, which is
fine, just be sure to treat them as the sacred gifts which they are. When recording
(whether by audio or through writing), be sure to avoid trying to edit until after your
experience has been had.
