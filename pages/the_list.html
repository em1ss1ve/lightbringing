<p>
I don't know about you, but I consider myself to be a Real American, and by that I mean that I truly believe in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I too feel like I was lied to by the liberal elites, and I too want to see a radical return to the roots of the promise of the American dream.
</p>

<p>
Growing up, I was shown the beauty of Truth, Justice, Verdance, and Peace, only to be slapped with the force of millions of gasoline chugging automobiles and cruelty towards the least advantaged. I was raised christian, I was raised to believe above all, the most important ideas were to love God, and to love your neighbor as yourself. Now, I don't know about you, but I've seen a LOT of Christians who must then either hate themselves, or are completely full of shit, and didn't read a single thing that Jesus actually said, and it was for this reason that I became so thoroughly uncomfortable with identifying myself as Christian. I was raised to believe that part of what it meant to be a follower of Christ was to use the faculties that we were given by God to better understand the world, for why would He have given us those faculties if not for that reason? To more deeply understand the world is to more deeply understand the perfect beauty of God's creation, so science ought to be one of the deepest expressions of our love for God. I was taught to believe in the <i>inherent goodness</i> possible in every person, in the possibility for redemption, but was shown very little other than hatred and vitriol for anyone who expressed any degree of difference by many of these same teachers. They seemed to say, 'Love thy neighbor, unless they're queer, or black, or an immigrant, or a liberal', and it was this deep hypocrisy which turned me away from the Church. They justified this stance by saying, 'Well, it's actually an expression of love to force difference to homogenize. We're preventing them from sinning', but that doesn't sound like the love that I was told was Christ's love, which we should all aspire to. That is a love which is boundless, unconditional, and endlessly generous; it's a love which transcends all of the superficial and external expressions of the Spirit given us, one which accepts, rather than looks past difference. I was taught that Justice was another of the greatest expressions of the Love of God, but when I looked around I saw multinational corporations built off the exploitation of the poor and the rest of 'god's creation', with no integrity, and a directive to place profit over EVERYTHING else, and a government that was so thoroughly corrupt it was and continues to be unwilling to do anything to stop this, even though it claims to hold certain truths to be self evident. A government, which I might add, is now claiming to profess the same values I hold dear. I grew up with a belief in conservation, and protecting the bountiful garden which God has given us, but everywhere I look I see a society intent on nothing but loveless exploition, and people throwing up their hands and saying that there's nothing they can do about it, when it is us with whom the system is constructed. I was raised to believe that education was the greatest gift that can be given because it utilises our God given intellect to better understand Him and His creation, yet I look around and all I see are more and more intense attempts to strip our educational system of funding, and to fool us into stripping ourselves of our education, mindlessly consuming ourselves into an oblivion of hollowness, the greatest tool of eduction which has EVER been constructed (the internet) coopted by corporations intent on nothing more than seeking a profit, educational websites coated in advertisements or locked behind paywalls, and my peers addicted to endless cycles of chewing on each other in the refuse pits of "social" media, their time, attention, curiosity, and love mined to line the pockets of the already laden one percent. Does <i>any</i> of this sound like a just society? A peaceful society? A society in line with love?
</p>

<p>
Now, as I've grown, my understanding of 'God' has changed significantly from the 'man upstairs' of Christianity, but my belief in Christ's fundamental axioms has only deepened, as has my belief in the promise of the American Dream, however far it may seem right now. I've come to understand Christ as representing a path towards freedom from the attachments which make us suffer, one which isn't at it's core terribly different from Buddhism. He preached an ascetic life, 'it's harder for a rich person to enter heaven than it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle' (which means exactly what it says on the tin, as proven by Christ repeatedly advising people to give up their wealth to feed the poor), and taught that the only way to be free from the suffering of mortal flesh is to give up one's attachments (sins), and to turn onesself totally towards compassion for other sentient beings and love.
</p>

I was raised somewhat conservatively. I say somewhat, because though I was taught very rigid gender expectations and a very healthy degree of skepticism, I was also taught that we should care for the least advantaged. When I was in middle school, I became depressed, and I think this was in large part because of the hopelessness I felt about the world around me. Additionally, I was extremely transphobic, and it was only when a friend of mine in high school suggested, 'perhaps the reason you hate trans people so much is because you are trans' that I was forced to consider the possibility. It was quite harshly forced on me to believe that there were certain ways that boys acted and certain ways that girls acted, and because of the arbitrary flesh suit I had found myself within, that I had to act in a certain way, even if that went against the ways towards which I was naturally inclined. When I was forced to confront that possibility, I recalled the despair of my childhood at my parents unwillingness to allow me to be who I was and how I had changed myself to fit their expectations, and I also realised that I didn't want to grow to be at all a man. I hid this for several years through highschool, where it metasticized, knowing with every passing day that I was getting closer to becoming something which felt wholly disingenuous, and this came to a head with a near miss suicide attempt an my senior year of high school. I came out to my parents just in time for Covid to shut the world down, which I gratefully accepted as a time to transition, and returned to school a much happier and more fulfilled person. Who would have guessed, but when I decided to live a life focused on love and authenticity, I found my own curiosity once again, and my hopelessness significantly diminished. I went from a student who couldn't be bothered to do any assignments that they weren't directly interested in to a straight-A student, from depressed and somber to passionate and exuberant. I joined Student Government and fought for gender neutral bathrooms, knowing directly how uncomfortable it can be to use bathrooms when you don't conform to social norms of gender. The worst part is and has always been the fear of making someone else feel uncomfortable because I'm trying to use the restroom, and for a long time I put a ton of effort into trying to 'pass' in order to avoid confronting people with their own discomfort about my queerness. It's a very strange catch-twenty-two, given that if you don't try to fit in, you worry you're making others uncomfortable, and if you do, you're worried someone might kill you for 'tricking them'. But then again, all that's just because we've put such a heavy emphasis on hating difference in our culture, especially when that difference is queer. I think the reason why queerness faces such fear and vitriol is because it embodies possibility; how is one to justify killing their own dreams and curiosity to fit in, when others are willing not to fit in that they can chase what they truly want from life? I think part of the reason why I started pursuing art was because the term 'artist' represented for me the space to be who I wanted, but the reason I stay is because it allows me to create the world I want to see.
</p>

<p>
During highschool, I became thoroughly disillusioned with the world, as is the case for most, but part of what drove it was the seeming meaninglessness of life; I gave up on the idea that there was a god driving the universe, and this led to me being forced to confront the purpose of my life. For years I searched, looking around me with greater despair at all of the people who seemed to me to succumb to the fiction that money leads to happiness, all while those same people seemed hollow, lacking in passion and curiosity, beaten into submission by the threat of deprivation. I didn't see a future for myself; what I saw in these people around me was so horrible a fate that I felt I'd rather die than succumb, that I'd kill myself before The System™ could do it. Not only that, but I was told that trans people didn't deserve to exist, that they were abominations, inherently sinful; especially for this did I think I should die. After all, I felt myself to be an abomination in no small part because of the growing disconnect between who I felt myself to be, and what I thought my body would grow into. After I started my transition, that disconnect began to lessen, as did the suicidal thoughts, but they were still driven by the idea that even if I had a future, it would be little more than working a pointless job and watching the planet disintegrate around me, knowing that by doing that job, I was likely contributing to making it worse. I stumbled across Buddhism, and it promised to help work through the turmoil I was experiencing, as well as providing a meaning to my life. Buddhism showed me that everything was incredibly plastic because of how thoroughly interconnected all life is: make life better for some, and they will in turn make life better. This view of collective liberation through individual action deeply implanted itself into my mind, rewriting much of the doomerism which plagued me, while also providing me a reason for being: as an agent of transformation towards compassion. This same idea also gave my art purpose. What I had felt for so long was nothing more than a pastime became something which had the possibility to show people a brighter and more compassionate future, and to illuminate deeper truths about the present.
</p>

<p>
While I attended Pikes Peak, in the skill-focused classes, I pushed for more with my work, endlessly trying to upend our critiques; I looked at the art around me and felt that it was a similar shell to the passionless people which I so feared to become. I already felt like I had to fight to express who I was, so fighting for the same with my art seemed to be no different. With some teachers I found more freedom than with others, and in my last semester I was gifted a teacher who allowed me to express myself without constraint, likely because she was fresh from New York and hadn't yet got the memo. This was absurdly important at the time. Near the end of the previous semester I lost a couple friends in the Club Q shooting, and was dealing with the grief combined with similar feelings of hopelessness about a world that seemed intent on destroying queerness, and the free expression in that art class provided an invaluable place for me to process those feelings, even if I left crying part of the way through class on some days. Art provided a relief, a distraction which put me into a zone where I felt that I could sit with the pain without having to face it directly, a safe degree of space in which to process. 
</p>

<p>
I crashed after that semester. I think it was the combination of the work-load that I was facing in school with the emotional turmoil, but I realised I had to take some time to deal with what I was feeling before I stood any chance of realistically returning to school and achieving anything. I was also convinced that my mother was going to drink herself to death, and figured I would take what little time I had with her to spend while I still had it, she was drinking so heavily. Alcoholism wasn't limited to her, and my stepfather was also drinking very heavily; both ended up going to rehab that winter, and I enrolled for the spring semester at UCCS. I was still trying to find my footing, what with all that I had gone through in the past year, the work I made during that time largely embodied an interiority which isn't representative of my current work, and much of which I feel is largely reprehensible, but for which I am still grateful. The summer following that semester I read, and read, and read, and thought, and drew, and thought, and read, and watched, and slowly a cohesive vision for my work began to manifest; I saw the promise within religion, but hadn't yet figured out how to represent such a thing.
</p>

<p>
My art from the fall of '24 embodies a queer love of the promised land; a fascination with the beauty of transcendance in the face of the horrors of the world, and an endless curiosity about boundless love in the face of hatred and cruelty. All the work created during this semester embodies a cohesive vision related to contemporary socio-religious identity as represented through the performance of faith as manifest in culture. During this time, I was (and continue to be) obsessed with the different ways that faith contradicts action and dogma contradicts doctrine. I'm obsessed with queered religion; pure, unfiltered, endlessly accepting, infinitely diverse love, even in the face of horror and fear. I'm obsessed with post-ironic culture jamming of the christian right, with the cultivation of curiosity and imagination as expressions of love, the beauty of the imperfection of human logic as it tries to grasp the infinite, and with the perfection of perseverance and the humanity which it implies.

Life
</p>

<p>
It seems time to truly examine the right to life; where previously life was determined to be something which is entirely individual, climate change has made the inherent interconnection of our lives searingly obvious. An interconnected life is one which flourishes as the result of the health of the total ecosystem, one where action is seen in the context of the rippling effects of throughout the systems within which we are embedded. The right to life is understood in this context as the right to be and experience parts of a system in which life (as beyond mere survival) can flourish unconstrained. I want to see a society where life is so sweet and compassion so generous that no one wishes to die and in which there is nothing for which to kill.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Liberty
</p>

<p>
True freedom depends on the freedom of every individual. We all can make any choice in any moment, and such choices are inherent to the human condition, even if those choices are limited somewhat by environment; even in a concrete cell, one still has a near infinite amount of freedom, though that freedom is far more limited in scope than an individual not constrained. Liberty is understood thus as <i>ability to cause</i>, and compassionate liberty is to be understood as <i>ability to cause benefit</i>. As such, the right to compassionate liberty ought to be constructed through the understanding of increasing the actionable liberties of every individual; to live in a system where to quit one's job is to doom oneself to starvation is not to live in a truly free system where individuals can easily direct their talents towards the benefit of others. True liberty would be the possibility to move at any time, to any place, for any reason, and to not have to worry about dying from deprivation. True liberty would be to work any job, to chase any dream, to be anyone, as long as these don't deny other's liberty. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
Pursuit of Happiness
</p>

<p>
This is not currently a society in which true happiness is at all valued. If we did truly value happiness for our citizens, we would provide any medically necessary healthcare for free. We would provide individuals with food, with clothing, with housing, and we wouldn't bat an eye. To ensure the basic necessities of every individual is to ensure the health, <i>the Life</i>, of the society. To <i>care</i> is to flourish, and to remove the threat of death will only lead to greater innovation, to greater freedom, to greater achievement as life. It seems the reason why so many people want to kill themself in the contemporary moment is because they are deeply compassionate people filled with such pain upon looking at a world which seems only invested in causing pain, that the only possible cessation to that suffering is suicide. To look around and see a dying world in which no-one seems truly dedicated to bettering is quite obviously going to cause despair. What we often seem to miss is that the change needs to start with ourselves, that the only way others will care is if they know they will be supported in the emotional investment required for working towards a brighter future, and that it's us who can be there to help. I would guess that almost everyone has at some point realized the horrors of the world, but most have responded by looking away, by looking towards the temporary satisfaction of materialism for a distraction from the yawning blood-pit within which they sit. I see this, ironically, as proof of the fundamental goodness of people; they have compassion within themselves for those around them, even if they're scared to face the pain of looking. It takes bravery to face the heartbreak of living in a world marred by intentional callousness, but it's those who are the most callous who believe that the only way to survive in this world is to turn off the part of ourselves that cares. How we should love them even more! By building a compassionate world, we help each other (and ourselves) to find healing and openness. I want to live in a world in which I had been told "Yeah, that isn't fair, how do you think we can fix it?" rather than "Life's unfair". We close ourselves off to possibility because it removes our inward expectation of action and the friction such action causes against how we are told to live by contemporary society. That which makes the lightness of being 'unbearable' is only that we do not live in accordance with it.

<p>
I feel the possibility of a world where we live to work towards beauty in everything we do.
</p>

<p>
I define beauty as the embodiment of unconditional and infinite compassion, as echoed in vastness.
</p>

<p>
I want to be in a world where we work collectively to achieve collective benefit, where we choose to work as an expression of our reverence for the beauty we recognize within one another, and within everything around us.
</p>

<p>
I want to be in a world where knowledge, creation, compassion, and material necessities are freely given for the benefit of all life, to all life.
</p>

<p>
I want to be in a world where imagination and curiosity are prized more highly than "being right", where people work towards the highest degree of truth without judgement for error.
</p>

<p>
I want to be in a world where we live <i>with</i> nature, rather than 'near' it, where life grows freely from the cracks in our hearts, in which we know there is nothing and no-'one' to die; where we all are just one possibility for being endlessly transforming beauty, where there is all that is, not you or me.
</p>

<p>
Where vines grow freely through our windows and trees support our roofs. Where technology supports life rather than suppressing it; where information is seen to flow through every living being, an endless network of shifting impressions and wisdom. Where innovation is never at the detriment of life, but to its' betterment. Where diversity is understood by all to create greater resilience, as an expression of beauty as possibility.
</p>

<p>
Will you live this world together?
