        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        <p>
          I have created this page as a means of collecting and sharing concepts that I'm
          developing which guide my work, as well as the work I've made. I hope that you
          leave with more than you arrived.

          <h3>A list of actionable ideas:</h3>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>I think it would be of benefit to begin creating a council within the education system, formed of professors;
                  I forsee this working as a hub. In the center of the hub are a small group of individuals who are elected from the larger body 
                  of the field that they are to represent, and are to act as the spokespeople for presenting their field's information to the 
                  council and to the public. This council would be tasked with gathering and oversight of information regarding solutions to
                  the various social issues that we face as a society, and the presentation and prioritization thereof.</li>
            <br>
              <li>I think it would be greatly beneficial for this group to also be responsible for the oversight of creation and maintenence
                  of a website which is to act as a collection of important statistics and the modelling of the relationships which these 
                  statistics have with one another for the purposes of revealing to the general public the forces which are responsible for 
                  shaping the world which they interact with. This could also serve as an important place to present the opportunity for people 
                  to explore topics by subject, providing a centralized location with links to <i>open source</i> papers and information dealing
                  with these subjects. Please, for the love of the sacredness of information and truth, let's kill copyright.</li>
              <br>
              <li>We need to reevaluate the multifaceted usages of ourselves by computers, and consider choosing to reclaim our power as
                  <b>users</b>, lest we remain used. <a href = "https://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/">Turing Complete User by Olia Lialina, 2010</a>
                  Websites provides a more personal experience of someone, promising all the affordances of 
                  social media (and more) while retaining complete control over how our information is used, and it isn't a terribly difficult skill to learn... Consider 
                  <i>using</i> the web. Consider <i>browsing</i> the web, wandering amongst the catacombs and finding fascinating tidbits along the way,
                  rather than being forced to follow some path lain for "optimal engagement". Ramble and refuse to be used, refuse to be 
                  lulled into habitual, obsessive consumption. Our relationship with each other will start to heal once sharing returns to something
                  occurring in the medium of interpersonal communication rather than interalgorithm communication. Why should an algorithm have <i>any
                  </i> control over what is seen and shared by and between us?</li> 
            </ul>
