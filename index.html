        <p>
          I have created this page as a means of collecting and sharing concepts that I'm
          developing which guide my work, as well as the work I've made. I hope that you
          leave with more than you arrived.

              <l1>I think it would be of benefit to begin creating a council within the education system, formed of professors;
                  I forsee this working as a hub. In the center of the hub are a small group of individuals who are elected from the larger body 
                  of the field that they are to represent, and are to act as the spokespeople for presenting their field's information to the 
                  council and to the public. This council would be tasked with gathering and oversight of information regarding solutions to
                  the various social issues that we face as a society, and the presentation and prioritization thereof.</l1>
